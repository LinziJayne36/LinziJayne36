- 👋 Hi, I’m Linzi. Some of you might know me from X (Twitter), where I've been logging my daily coding journey for just over a year.
- 👀 I’m interested in web technologies and have had a special interest in the front end. However, full-stack is of increasing interest to me.
- I've done a series of 7 day challenges in Python, Java, C# and Ruby. Of all those, Ruby was my favourite ❤️ and I will be using Ruby On Rails to create an API backend for an upcoming project.
-  I've been learning JavaScript in more depth, have been using Angular and TypeScript, and most recently have been getting acquainted with Nuxt 3. I also still consider myself to be learning more about HTML and CSS, despite having a decent grasp on the fundamentals, have been using Sass for quite a while, and most recently have been test-driving Tailwind.
- 📫 How to reach me ... The best way to get my attention (about anything related to programming) is to DM me over on X, where you'll find me as @LjCodes.
