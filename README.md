- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Linzi. Some of you might know me from X (Twitter), where I'm currently nearing the end of the 365 Days of Code challenge (started as 100 days of code but after the 2nd time I changed it).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web technologies and have a special interest in the front end. That said: I'm also looking forward to acquiring some back-end skills, as I progress through The Odin Project curriculum, and have also done a series of 7 day challenges in Python, Java with C# and Ruby to follow.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript in more depth and have recently started learning React and TypeScript. I also still consider myself to be learning more about HTML and CSS, despite having a decent grasp on the fundamentals, and have started using Sass.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... The best way to get my attention (about anything related to programming) is to DM me over on X, where you'll find me as @LjCodes.
