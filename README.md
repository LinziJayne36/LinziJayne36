- 👋 Hi, I’m Linzi. Some of you might know me from X (Twitter), where I'd been logging my daily coding journey for more than 700 days.
- 👀 My interest in web technologies began with a special focus on the front end. However, full-stack is now of increasing interest to me.
- I've done a series of 7 day challenges in Python, Java, C# and Ruby. Of all those, Ruby was my favourite ❤️ and I'm now using Ruby On Rails to create an API backend for a side project.
-  I've been learning JavaScript in more depth, have used Angular and TypeScript to create a CV builder, and most recently have been getting acquainted with Nuxt 3. I also still consider myself to be learning more about HTML and CSS, despite having a decent grasp on the fundamentals. I've also been using Sass for quite a while and, most recently, have been test-driving Tailwind.
- 📫 How to reach me ... The best way to get my attention (about anything related to programming) is to DM me over on X, where you'll find me as @LjCodes.
