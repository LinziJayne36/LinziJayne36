- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Linzi. Some of you might know me from Twitter, where I'm currently logging my progress in doing round 2 of the 100 Days of Code challenge.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web technologies and I have a special interest in the front end.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript in more depth and have recently started learning React. I also still consider myself to be learning more about HTML and CSS, despite having a decent grasp on the fundamentals.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... The best way to get my attention (about anything related to programming) is to DM me over on Twitter, where you'll find me as @LjCodes.
